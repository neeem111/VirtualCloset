# VirtualCloset – Challenges

## HIGH PRIORITY CHALLENGES

1.  **Outfit Recommendation Personalization**
    The main feature of VirtualCloset is generating outfits based on the user’s wardrobe, weather, and personal style. The challenge is ensuring that the recommendation system feels personalized while keeping the interface simple and not overwhelming. Users must easily adjust preferences such as style, color palettes, and clothing categories.

2.  **Wardrobe Digitalization – Scanning & Photo Input**
    Users should be able to add clothes not only through manual input but also by scanning labels or taking photos. The challenge is designing an interaction flow that makes the process fast, intuitive, and accurate, without requiring users to retake images or manually adjust too many fields.

3.  **Multimodal Interaction for Adding Items**
    VirtualCloset supports multiple input methods to add garments: text form, photo capture, and barcode scanning. The challenge is communicating clearly when each method is appropriate and ensuring the user understands how to switch between them effortlessly.

4.  **Perception of Time During Outfit Generation**
    Outfit generation requires processing time. It’s essential to manage user expectations with animations, micro-interactions, and progress feedback so that the waiting time feels short and engaging, preventing frustration.

5.  **Language Support for International Users**
    The app should be usable by people worldwide. This challenge focuses on providing multilingual support, ensuring translations fit well within UI elements and maintaining consistent terminology.

6.  **Font Size & Accessibility**
    VirtualCloset must accommodate users with visual impairments. Dynamic font sizing, high-contrast themes, accessible labels, and clear icons are key challenges for ensuring readability when browsing outfits or clothing details.

7.  **Adaptive Outfit Complexity**
    Users vary in their fashion knowledge. Some prefer simple outfits, while others want advanced styling ideas. The challenge is enabling the app to adjust outfit complexity based on user expertise—e.g., beginner suggestions vs. advanced layering combinations.

8.  **Onboarding for an Empty Closet**
    A new user starts with an empty wardrobe, which may reduce engagement. Designing a smooth, motivating onboarding flow that guides users through adding their first items without overwhelming them is a crucial challenge.

## SECONDARY PRIORITY CHALLENGES

1.  **Cognitive Load in Wardrobe Management**
    Managing a large wardrobe can overwhelm users. The challenge is organizing filters, categories, colors, and seasons to avoid cognitive overload while still giving users powerful sorting tools.

2.  **Visual Attention When Viewing Outfits**
    When an outfit is displayed full-screen, the most important elements (garments, color combinations, alternatives) must be highlighted. The challenge is guiding the user’s attention visually without clutter.

3.  **Distraction & Multitasking**
    Users may use the app while dressing, in a hurry, or with limited attention. The challenge is to design clear, minimal interactions that support quick decision-making under distraction.

4.  **Voice Interaction for Hands-Free Browsing**
    Voice commands (e.g., “Show next outfit”, “Details”, “Save this look”) would be helpful for accessibility and hands-free situations. The challenge lies in integrating voice interaction without confusing the experience or overloading the UI.

5.  **Multiple Login & Identity Methods**
    Allowing login via email, Google, Apple, or social platforms reduces friction. The challenge is presenting these options clearly without cluttering the onboarding flow.

6.  **User Motivation & Habit Formation**
    To encourage repeated use, the app may reward users for wearing more of their existing clothes or reducing fast-fashion purchases. Designing motivational nudges without feeling intrusive is a key challenge.

7.  **Subtle Feedback & Micro-Interactions**
    Small animations or haptic feedback should confirm actions like saving a look, adding clothes, or generating an outfit. The challenge is ensuring these cues feel helpful rather than distracting.

8.  **Emotionally Supportive & Motivational Design**
    The app should create positive feelings celebrating outfit diversity, encouraging sustainable use of clothes, and supporting user confidence. The challenge is balancing emotional tone without appearing patronizing or overly gamified.

9.  **Smart & Non-Intrusive Notifications**
    Weather alerts, event reminders, or daily outfit suggestions must be helpful without feeling annoying. Balancing timely notifications with user control is a key challenge.
